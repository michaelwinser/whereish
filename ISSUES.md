### 1. Link sharing for anonymous viewers
Add support for shareable links that create a contact-like entity with assigned permissions. Anyone with the link can view the user's location at the permission level set for that link. This enables sharing location with people who aren't contacts (e.g., "here's where I am for the next hour" scenarios).

### 2. Implement major OAuth provider login
Add authentication via major OAuth providers (Google, Apple, etc.) to replace the prototype's simple email-based registration. This provides better security and user convenience.
